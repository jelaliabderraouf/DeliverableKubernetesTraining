Chocolatey Installation Steps

1- First, ensure that you are using an administrative shell - you can also install as a non-admin, check out Non-Administrative Installation.

2- Install with powershell.exe
   
   With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. 
   We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

   Run:
   > Get-ExecutionPolicy 
   
    If it returns Restricted, then run 
    > Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned 
   
    or 
    > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
   
  Now run the following command:

   > Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

   Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.
   If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey! Type choco or choco -? now, or see Getting Started for usage instructions.
